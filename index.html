            C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables
            developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that
            run on the .NET Framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web
            services, distributed components, client-server applications,
            database applications, and much, much more. Visual C# provides an
            advanced code editor, convenient user interface designers,
            integrated debugger, and many other tools to make it easier to
            develop applications based on the C# language and the .NET
            Framework.

            C Sharp Language
          </header>
          <p>
            C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to
            learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable
            to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of
            these languages are typically able to begin to work productively in
            C# within a very short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the
            complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable
            value types, enumerations, delegates, lambda expressions and direct
            memory access, which are not found in Java. C# supports generic
            methods and types, which provide increased type safety and
            performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection
            classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use
            by client code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make
            the strongly-typed query a first-class language construct
          </p>
          <p>Some coding examples of C sharp are as follows:</p>
          <code>
             int x = 20;
            string firstName= "Gashaw"; double x = 20.10; char y ='G',
          </code>
          <p>Console output</p>
          <code>
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
          </code>
          <p>string concatenation:<p>
          <code>
            string firstFriend = "Gashaw"; string
            secondFriend = "Ayele"; Console.WriteLine($"My friends are
            {firstFriend} and {secondFriend}");
          </code>
          <p>Conditionals</p>
          <code>
            if (Boolean expression) { Body of the conditional statement; } else
            { Body of the else statement; }
          </code>
          <p>Do-While Loops:</p>
          <code>do { executable code; } while (condition);</code>
          <p>
            As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of
            encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All variables and
            methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point,
            are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit
            directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of
            interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class
            require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental
            redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a
            stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not
            support inheritance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# makes it
            easy to develop software components through several innovative
            language constructs, including the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            Encapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable
            type-safe event notifications
          </li>
          <li>
            Properties, which serve as accessors for private member variables
          </li>
          <li>
            Attributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run
            time
          </li>
          <li>Inline XML documentation comments.</li>
          <li>
            Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) which provides built-in query
            capabilities across a variety of data sources
          </li>
            </ul>

           DotNET Framework Platform Architecture

          <p>
            C# programs run on the .NET Framework, an integral component of
            Windows that includes a virtual execution system called the common
            language runtime (CLR) and a unified set of class libraries. The CLR
            is the commercial implementation by Microsoft of the common language
            infrastructure (CLI), an international standard that is the basis
            for creating execution and development environments in which
            languages and libraries work together seamlessly
          </p>
          <p>
            Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language
            (IL) that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code and
            resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored on disk in an
            executable file called an assembly, typically with an extension of
            .exe or .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides
            information about the assembly's types, version, culture, and
            security requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the
            CLR, which might take various actions based on the information in
            the manifest. Then, if the security requirements are met, the CLR
            performs just in time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code to
            native machine instructions. The CLR also provides other services
            related to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and
            resource management. Code that is executed by the CLR is sometimes
            referred to as "managed code," in contrast to "unmanaged code" which
            is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific
            system.

          <header>Why C# is being popular</header>
          <p>
            C# has many other reasons for being popular and in demand. Few of
            the reasons are mentioned below:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong> Easy to start:</strong> C# is a high-level language so it
              is closer to other popular programming languages like C, C++, and
              Java and thus becomes easy to learn for anyone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Widely used for developing Desktop and Web Application:</strong
              >
              C# is widely used for developing web applications and Desktop
              applications. It is one of the most popular languages that is used
              in professional desktop. If anyone wants to create Microsoft apps,
              C# is their first choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community:</strong>The larger the community the better it
              is as new tools and software will be developing to make it better.
              C# has a large community so the developments are done to make it
              exist in the system and not become extinct.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Game Development:</strong> C# is widely used in game
              development and will continue to dominate. C# integrates with
              Microsoft and thus has a large target audience. The C# features
              such as Automatic Garbage Collection, interfaces, object-oriented,
              etc. make C# a popular game developing language

          <header>Difference between Python and C#</header>
          <p>
            C# is an object-oriented programming language, is pronounced as
            C-Sharp. This language was developed to compete with Java, by
            Microsoft under the leadership of Anders Heijlberg and his team.
            Like python it does not free of cost, it comes with the license. It
            is a compiled language rather than an interpreted language. There
            are 86 total keywords used in the C# language. In c#, pointers are
            used only in unsafe mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is a multi-paradigm programming language such as
            object-oriented programming and structured programming and many
            others. It was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.
            There are 33 total keywords used in the python 3.7. It doesn’t
            support pointers. It is dynamic-type language whereas C# is
            static-type language. It is easier than C# in order to learn
